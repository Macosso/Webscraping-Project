# Webscraping-Project
In this code we scrape app reviews, ratings, and release date of popular apps on multiple devices the data is being scraped from https://www.commonsensemedia.org Warning: these are not official reviews on respective platforms. unlike playstore and app store where the user can only review apps that thety have used, this website does not have such restriction, thus leading to questions regardig the quality of reviews. However, these reviews are usually made by professionals, hence reducing risks of spurious reviews. The datawas scraped using 3 different web scraping frameworks (Beautifulsoup, Selenium, and Scrappy). Then we compare the efficiency of each scraper.
